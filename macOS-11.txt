Package manager
==============================
`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
`echo >> $HOME/.zprofile`
`echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shelling)"' >> $HOME/.zprofile`
`eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"`
This also installs command line tools (`xcode-select --install`).

```
brew install mullvadvpn
mullvad account login <accountid>
mullvad beta-program set on
mullvad auto-connect set on
mullvad lockdown-mode set on

mullvad relay set tunnel-protocol wireguard
mullvad tunnel set ipv6 off
mullvad connect
```

Create five additional profiles and copy settings from Default to each:
```
cp -r $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Chromium/Default/* $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Chromium/Profile\ 1/
cp -r $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Chromium/Default/* $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Chromium/Profile\ 2/
cp -r $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Chromium/Default/* $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Chromium/Profile\ 3/
cp -r $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Chromium/Default/* $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Chromium/Profile\ 4/
cp -r $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Chromium/Default/* $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Chromium/Profile\ 5/
